If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.

(In 2012 he said he was interested in helping, so I put his name on it. Since he only did a few suggestions, and was not interested in editing, I removed his name the next year). Also, the "2009-2018" should read "2007-2018". Thank you! very much appreciated. Yours in the Messiah, Wayne Mitchell / Editor NHEB.

The word G166 is an adjective, adding “lasting” to the root word of G165 “age”, thus correctly meaning “age lasting”. In Every verse where G166 is found, the word “age lasting” is always referring to the time period from the return of Christ, until final judgment, at which time all  of those in correction will be released from the grasp of death, and from the place of hades, and will be then be forgiven, and purified along with those of the first resurrection, by the fire that comes down from heaven, upon both, those inside the New Jerusalem, and those gathered around it.

I also understand that apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard. I have entered my corrections under the verse(s) below.

Proposed corrections to the Aionian Bible, John Chapter 3

1) Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewish people.

2) This man came to him at night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."

3) Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God."

4) Nicodemus said to him, "How can anyone be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"

5) Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

6) That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

7) Do not be surprised that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'

8) The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

9) Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How can these things be?"

10) Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?

11) Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our witness.

12) If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

13) And no one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.

14) And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

15) that whoever believes in him may have consummate (aiōnios g166) life.

16) For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have consummate life. (aiōnios g166)

17) For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.

18) He who believes in him is not judged.  He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

19) This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.

20) For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.

21) But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."

22) After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea.  He stayed there with them, and baptized.

23) Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there.  They came, and were baptized.

24) For John was not yet thrown into prison.

25) Now a dispute arose between John's disciples with a Jew about purification.

26) And they came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is coming to him."

27) John answered, "No one can receive anything, unless it has been given to him from heaven.

28) You yourselves bear me witness that I said, 'I am not the Messiah,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'

29) He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.  So this joy of mine is now complete.

30) He must increase, but I must decrease.

31) He who comes from above is above all.  He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth.  He who comes from heaven is above all.

32) What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.

33) He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.

34) For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for he does not give the Spirit by measure.

35) The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.

36) One who believes in the Son has consummate (aiōnios g166) life, but one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."

I have evaluated Speedata yesterday but my progress is slow. I have seen on their webpage that you have used it and your bible layouts look way better than what I have accomplished so far: http://softwarerero.com/SFB15-GEN.pdf Would you be willing to share an example data and layout file, this could maybe save me a lot of time. I have problems with:

- The spacing before and after paragraphs seems to be random and I have not found a way yet to control it.
- To render the page count the document has to be rendered twice and the code for it is ugly.
- Text flowing around images seems complicated and i haven't mastered it yet.
- There are widows and orphans and I see no easy way to avoid them.

Blessings,
Stefan

Thank Your very much for publishing Matupi Chin Standard Bible. As I am administrator of Matupi Chin Standard Bible committee I would like to correct your Browser Bible - Not Matu Chin Bible but it is Matupi Chin Standard Bible. Because we officially resisted as (MCSB).  

We MCSB committee translated Matupi Chin Standard Bible from original Hebrew and Greek text so we added strong numbers. And we translated DC version (Tobit, Judith, Esther Greek, Sriracha, Wisdom of Solomon, 1,2 Maccabees, 1Edras) if it possible we would like to publish DC Bible in online version.  

Thank You

May I ask if there are any copyright restrictions to creating an audio version of the Aionian  Bible? 

I would like to record it for my sons’ and others that may be interested. 

Do I need specific permissions to record it? Possibly to offer it  publicly for others to listen? 

In Christ.

devoured by me. After reading most New Testaments in study circumstances,I was profoundly influenced by what I perceived as a Spirit of the fear of God in its pages. It brought me to a powerful sense of my need for personal repentance. Since then I've owned and lost,or had removed from my library several different editions of the text in different bindings. By far the most helpful edition was a hardback copy with textual and commentary notes. Most profound! It's a great loss for the English Biblical student to have missed the opportunity to have his work to devour. Sincerely a lover of Jesus.

Proposed corrections to the Russian Synodal Translation, Genesis Chapter 1

1) В начале сотворил Бог небо и землю.

2) Земля же была безвидна и пуста, и тьма над бездною, и Дух Божий носился над водою.

3) И сказал Бог: да будет свет.  И стал свет.

4) И увидел Бог свет, что он хорош, и отделил Бог свет от тьмы.

5) И назвал Бог свет днем, а тьму ночью.  И был вечер, и было утро: день один.

6) И сказал Бог: да будет твердь посреди воды, и да отделяет она воду от воды.  И стало так.

7) И создал Бог твердь, и отделил воду, которая под твердью, от воды, которая над твердью.  И стало так.

8) И назвал Бог твердь небом.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.  И был вечер, и было утро: день второй.

9) И сказал Бог: да соберется вода, которая под небом, в одно место, и да явится суша.  И стало так.  И собралась вода под небом в свои места, и явилась суша.

10) И назвал Бог сушу землею, а собрание вод назвал морями.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.

11) И сказал Бог: да произрастит земля зелень, траву, сеющую семя по роду и по подобию ее, и дерево плодовитое, приносящее по роду своему плод, в котором семя его на земле.  И стало так.

12) И произвела земля зелень, траву, сеющую семя по роду и по подобию ее, и дерево плодовитое, приносящее плод, в котором семя его по роду его на земле.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.

13) И был вечер, и было утро: день третий.

14) И сказал Бог: да будут светила на тверди небесной для освещения земли и для отделения дня от ночи, и для знамений, и времен, и дней, и годов;

15) и да будут они светильниками на тверди небесной, чтобы светить на землю.  И стало так.

16) И создал Бог два светила великие: светило большее, для управления днем, и светило меньшее, для управления ночью, и звезды;

17) и поставил их Бог на тверди небесной, чтобы светить на землю,

18) и управлять днем и ночью, и отделять свет от тьмы.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.

19) И был вечер, и было утро: день четвертый.

20) И сказал Бог: да произведет вода пресмыкающихся, душу живую; и птицы да полетят над землею, по тверди небесной.  И стало так.

21) И сотворил Бог рыб больших и всякую душу животных пресмыкающихся, которых произвела вода, по роду их, и всякую птицу пернатую по роду ее.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.

22) И благословил их Бог, говоря: плодитесь и размножайтесь, и наполняйте воды в морях, и птицы да размножаются на земле.

23) И был вечер, и было утро: день пятый.

24) И сказал Бог: да произведет земля душу живую по роду ее, скотов, и гадов, и зверей земных по роду их.  И стало так.

25) И создал Бог зверей земных по роду их, и скот по роду его, и всех гадов земных по роду их.  И увидел Бог, что это хорошо.

26) И сказал Бог: сотворим человека по образу Нашему и по подобию Нашему, и да владычествуют они над рыбами морскими, и над птицами небесными, и над зверями, и над скотом, и над всею землею, и над всеми гадами, пресмыкающимися по земле.

27) И сотворил Бог человека по образу Своему, по образу Божию сотворил его; мужчину и женщину сотворил их.

28) И благословил их Бог, и сказал им Бог: плодитесь и размножайтесь, и наполняйте землю, и обладайте ею, и владычествуйте над рыбами морскими и над зверями, и над птицами небесными, и над всяким скотом, и над всею землею, и над всяким животным, пресмыкающимся по земле.

29) И сказал Бог: вот, Я дал вам всякую траву, сеющую семя, какая есть на всей земле, и всякое дерево, у которого плод древесный, сеющий семя; - вам сие будет в пищу;

30) а всем зверям земным, и всем птицам небесным, и всякому гаду, пресмыкающемуся по земле, в котором душа живая, дал Я всю зелень травную в пищу.  И стало так.

31) И увидел Бог все, что Он создал, и вот, хорошо весьма.  И был вечер, и было утро: день шестой.

However, these databases (specifically the `.txt` and `.noia` databases) contain no data about the book names in their particular language. 

For Example, the Albanian bible contains the following books

- Zanafilla (Genesis)
- Eksodi (Exodus)
- Levitiku (Leviticus)
- Numrat (Numbers)
...
...

But this data is not mentioned in the *.noia and *.txt database.

I am aware that it is present in the PDFs, but extracting text from PDF is not only imprecise(as data is stored as globs), and therefore using the text database is the only option. Downloading the PDF, for just the text data of names of books, (which is around 5-10 MBs) just to obtain a few KBs of text is not ideal as well.

I would suggest adding the names of books at the beginning of the database as metadata (Like how all the other details of the databases are present) starting with the # symbol before the verses. 

Please let me know if it is possible to add these details to the existing databases.

Ashish Jacob Sam.

Proposed corrections to the American Standard Version 1901, Genesis Chapter 1
http://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---American-Standard-Version-1901/Genesis/1

1) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2) And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

3) And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

4) And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

5) And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.  And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

6) And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

7) And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

8) And God called the firmament Heaven.  And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.

9) And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

10) And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

11) And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.

12) And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.

13) And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

14) And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:

15) and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

16) And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.

17) And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,

18) and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

19) And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

20) And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

21) And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

22) And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.

23) And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

24) And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.

25) And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

26) And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

27) And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

28) And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

29) And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:

30) and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.

31) And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.  And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

I am a retired Pastor/Theologian and am quite interested in your "un-translation" as I have always preached/taught that the Bible we use is often misunderstood due to Translators erring on the side of caution. Chirst is a transliterated word. In Greese you would "Christos" your Turkey before you baked it, is one example.

Proposed corrections to the Cebuano Bible, John Chapter 16
https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/Cebuano---Cebuano-Bible/John/16

1) “Gisulti ko kaninyo kining mga butanga aron nga dili kamo mapahilayo.

2) Pagawason nila kamo sa mga sinagoga.  Apan ang takna moabot sa dihang ang matag-usa nga mopatay kaninyo maghunahuna nga siya nagdalit ug paghalad sa Dios.

3) Buhaton nila kining mga butanga tungod kay wala nila ako mailhi ug ang Amahan.

4) Gisulti ko kaninyo kining mga butanga aron nga sa dihang moabot ang ilang takna, makahinumdom kamo nga ako nagsulti kaninyo mahitungod kanila.  Wala ko kamo sultihi mahitungod niining mga butanga sa sinugdanan tungod kay ako uban kaninyo.

5) Apan karon moadto ako kaniya nga nagpadala kanako, apan walay usa kaninyo ang nangutana kanako, 'Asa ka moadto?'

6) Apan tungod kay ako miingon niining mga butanga kaninyo, napuno sa kaguol ang inyong kasingkasing.

7) Apan sultihan ko kamo sa kamatuoran: mas maayo alang kaninyo nga mobiya ako.  Kay kung dili ako mobiya, ang Maghuhupay dili moabot kaninyo, apan kung mobiya ako, ipadala ko siya kaninyo.

8) Sa dihang siya moabot, ang Maghuhupay magapamatuod nga ang kalibotan sayop mahitungod sa sala, mahitungod sa pagkamatarong, ug mahitungod sa paghukom—

9) mahitungod sa sala, tungod kay wala sila mituo kanako;

10) mahitungod sa pagkamatarong, tungod kay moadto ako sa Amahan, ug dili na kamo makakita kanako;

11) ug mahitungod sa paghukom, tungod kay ang tigdumala niining kalibotana gihukman na.

12) Daghan pang mga butang ang isulti ko kaninyo, apan dili kamo makasabot niini karon.

13) Apan sa dihang siya, ang Espiritu sa Kamatuoran, moabot, mogiya siya kaninyo sa tanan nga kamatuoran, kay dili siya magasulti gikan sa iyang kaugalingon.  Apan mosulti siya sa bisan unsa nga iyang madungog, ug isulti niya kaninyo kung unsa ang moabot.

14) Himayaon niya ako, tungod kay kuhaon niya kung unsa ang anaa kanako ug isulti niya kini kaninyo.

15) Ang tanang butang nga iya sa Amahan akoa.  Busa, moingon ako nga kuhaon sa Espiritu kung unsa ang anaa kanako ug isulti niya kini kaninyo.

16) Sa mubo nga higayon dili kamo makakita kanako, ug human sa mubo nga higayon makakita kamo kanako.”

17) Unya pipila sa iyang mga disipulo miingon sa matag-usa, ''Unsa kining iyang giingon kanato, 'Sa mubo nga higayon dili kamo makakita kanako ug human sa mubo nga higayon makakita kamo kanako,' ug, 'Tungod kay ako moadto sa Amahan'?”

18) Busa miingon sila, “Unsa kining iyang ginaingon, 'Sa mubo nga higayon'?  Wala kita nasayod kung unsa ang iyang gipanulti.”

19) Nakita ni Jesus nga buot nilang mangutana kaniya, ug miingon siya kanila, ''Mao ba kini ang inyong gipangutana sa inyong kaugalingon mahitungod sa akong giingon, 'Sa mubo nga higayon dili kamo makakita kanako ug human sa mubo nga higayon makakita kamo kanako'?

20) Sa pagkatinuod, sa pagkatinuod, moingon ako kaninyo, manghilak kamo ug magbangotan, apan ang kalibotan malipay; mapuno kamo sa kaguol, apan ang inyong kagul-anan ilisan ug kalipay.

21) Sa dihang ang babaye manganakay na naguol siya tungod kay hapit na ang takna sa iyang pagpanganak, apan sa dihang gihimugso na niya ang bata, dili na siya makahinumdom sa kasakit tungod sa iyang kalipay nga ang usa ka bata nga natawo sa kalibotan.

22) Busa naguol kamo karon, apan makita ko kamo pag-usab, ug malipay ang inyong kasingkasing, walay si bisan kinsa nga makakuha sa inyong kalipay gikan kaninyo.

23) Niana nga adlaw dili na kamo mangutana kanako ug bisan unsa.  Sa pagkatinuod, sa pagkatinuod, moingon ako kaninyo, kung mangayo kamo bisan unsa sa Amahan pinaagi sa akong ngalan, ihatag niya kini kaninyo.

24) Hangtod karon wala pa kamo nangayo ug bisan unsa pinaagi sa akong ngalan.  Pangayo, ug makadawat kamo aron ang inyong kalipay mahimong hingpit.

25) Miingon ako kaninyo niining mga butanga sa pasumbingay, apan moabot ang takna nga dili na ako mosulti kaninyo sa pasumbingay, kondili mosulti ako kaninyo sa klaro mahitungod sa Amahan.

26) Niana nga adlaw mangayo kamo pinaagi sa akong ngalan ug dili ako moingon kaninyo nga ako nag-ampo sa Amahan alang kaninyo,

27) kay ang Amahan mismo naghigugma kaninyo tungod kay nahigugma kamo kanako ug tungod kay mituo kamo nga ako gikan sa Amahan.

28) Gikan ako sa Amahan, ug mianhi ako sa kalibotan.  Usab, mobiya ako sa kalibotan ug moadto ako sa Amahan.”

29) Ang iyang mga disipulo miingon, ''Tan-awa, karon nagsulti ka na sa yano ug wala ka na migamit ug pasumbingay.

30) Karon nasayod na kami nga nasayod ka sa tanang butang, ug wala na nimo gikinahanglan si bisan kinsa aron mangutana kanimo.  Tungod niini, mituo kami nga ikaw gikan sa Dios.”

31) Si Jesus mitubag kanila, ''Nagtuo na ba kamo karon?

32) Tan-awa, ang takna moabotay na, Oo, ug miabot na gayod, sa dihang magkatibulaag kamo, ang matag-usa sa ilang kaugalingong panimalay, ug biyaan ninyo ako nga mag-inusara.  Apan wala ako mag-inusara tungod kay ang Amahan uban kanako.

33) Gisulti ko kaninyo kining mga butanga aron nga kamo adunay kalinaw gikan kanako.  Sa kalibotan, aduna kamoy kasamok, apan pagmalig-on: Gibuntog ko na ang kalibotan.”

Proposed corrections to the Cebuano Bible, John Chapter 16
https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/Cebuano---Cebuano-Bible/John/16

1) “Gisulti ko kaninyo kining mga butanga aron nga dili kamo mapahilayo.

2) Pagawason nila kamo sa mga sinagoga.  Apan ang takna moabot sa dihang ang matag-usa nga mopatay kaninyo maghunahuna nga siya nagdalit ug paghalad sa Dios.

3) Buhaton nila kining mga butanga tungod kay wala nila ako mailhi ug ang Amahan.

4) Gisulti ko kaninyo kining mga butanga aron nga sa dihang moabot ang ilang takna, makahinumdom kamo nga ako nagsulti kaninyo mahitungod kanila.  Wala ko kamo sultihi mahitungod niining mga butanga sa sinugdanan tungod kay ako uban kaninyo.

5) Apan karon moadto ako kaniya nga nagpadala kanako, apan walay usa kaninyo ang nangutana kanako, 'Asa ka moadto?'

6) Apan tungod kay ako miingon niining mga butanga kaninyo, napuno sa kaguol ang inyong kasingkasing.

04/02/2023 03:04:52	71.38.64.212	~ Aly & Alek Hemme~ |   IsY'ae	lightheartedtruthcovenant@gmail.com	As part of my awakening, it has become completely imperative to me, to have the abiity to translate the scripture, personally, and have the ability to modify what word is shown for any specific term, based on the options available in the strongs definitions page, so that when i enter a value in that field, it updates in the full readable personal version, everywhere that term is found, that allows the change to be made to the specific spelling of the term. I pray this is possible. please let me know if you have any  questions, or if there is anything i can do to make this a reality. i think that everyone needs one of these - for your time and efforts you should make an app that people can download, i have an instinct that the whole world will be looking for this resource in the very near future; i will wish i can offer it to us, and maybe, it will already be done. May you be blessed in all that you do, and thanQ for your service to love and light.
