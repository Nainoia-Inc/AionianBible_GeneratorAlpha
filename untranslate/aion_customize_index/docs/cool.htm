<p>All <a href='/Preface' title='Preface and mission'>AionianBible.org</a> profits are donated to the <a href='https://CoolCup.org' title="Water in Jesus' name">CoolCup.org</a> water project. So many in this world do not have clean drinking water and safe wastewater disposal. This project sponsors new and existing efforts to provide the needy with water in Jesus' name. <a href='/Publisher' title='Contact Nainoia, Inc'>Contact us</a> for help with your water need or water ministry.</p>

<p>Apostle John records that Jesus asked the woman at the well for a cup of water in Samaria in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/John/4' title='John chapter 4' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/John/4");'>John chapter 4</a>. Jesus then spoke the truth in love to that woman and gave her <i>"springs of water that welled up to consummate life."</i> She then persuaded the whole town to believe and confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. Jesus also said in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/Mark/9' title='Mark 9:41' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/Mark/9");'>Mark 9:41</a>, <i>"For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward."</i> That is our motivation.</p>

<p>Why <a href='https://CoolCup.org' title="Water in Jesus' name">CoolCup.org</a>? Well Jesus said again in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/Matthew/10' title='Matthew 10:42' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/Matthew/10");'>Matthew 10:42</a>, <i>"And whoever gives one of these little ones just a <b>cup of cold water</b> to drink because he is a disciple, truly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."</i> A funny little observation is that <i>water</i> is missing in the underlying Greek, but certainly implied. And also in Greek modifers do not preceed the object, but follow. So Jesus actually said, <i>"And whoever gives one of these little ones just a <b>cup cold</b> to drink because he is a disciple, truly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."</i> We have no dispute with the common translation, but we thought the expression <i>cup cold</i> was well.. cool.</p>

<p>And we thought <a href='https://CoolCup.org' title="Water in Jesus' name">CoolCup.org</a> was even cooler. Jesus is our <i>cool cup</i> of water.</p>
